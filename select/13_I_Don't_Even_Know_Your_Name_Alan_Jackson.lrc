[00:07.38] Well, I was sitting in Roadhouse down on Highway 41
[00:11.32] You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
[00:15.23] I knew you didn't see me, I was in a corner booth
[00:18.93] Of course, you weren't my waitress, mine was missing her front tooth
[00:22.58] So I flagged you down for coffee, but I couldn't say a thing
[00:26.03] But I'm in love with you, baby, and I don't even know your name
[00:57.53] 
[00:30.60] I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name
[00:34.52] I've never been too good with all those sexual game
[00:38.43] So, maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
[00:41.88] I'm in love with you baby, and I don't even know your name
[01:10.88] 
[01:04.27] So I ordered straight Tequila, a little courage in a shot
[01:08.25] And I asked you for a date, and then I asked to tie the knot
[01:11.89] I got a little wasted, yeah I went a little far
[01:15.73] I finally got to hug you, and you helped me to my car
[01:19.37] The last thing I remember I heard myself say
[01:22.86] I'm in love with you baby, and I don't even know your name
[01:51.86] 
[01:27.65] I'm in love with you baby, I don't even know your name
[01:31.43] I've never been too good with all those sexual game
[01:35.15] So, maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
[01:38.64] I'm in love with you baby, and I don't even know your name
[02:07.64] 
[02:00.00] The next thing I remember, I was hearing wedding-bells
[02:04.86] Standing by a woman, in a long white lacy veil
[02:09.78] I raised the veil, and she smiled at me, without her left front tooth
[02:14.01] And I said "where the hell am I, and just who the hell are you?"
[02:19.58] She said "I was your waitress, and our last name's are now the same"
[02:24.05] "'Cause I'm married to you baby, and I don't even know your name"
[02:56.55] 
[02:29.31] Yeah, I'm married to a waitress, I don't even know her name
[02:33.13] I've never been to good at all those sexual games
[02:36.92] I never thought my love life would quite turn out this way
[02:40.57] Hey, I'm married to a waitress, and I don't even know her name
